# lampStackBashScript
This automates and makes setting up a LAMP stack on a clean Ubuntu install easy for me. If you find it helpful please let me know!
The sleep commands are in here only for readability/testing/visual reasons. They are not vital to the execution of this code.
A less visual and "trimmed" version is available as well
This is one of my first bash scripts for automating LAMP stack installations. Please leave suggestions or tips. 
Thank you!
